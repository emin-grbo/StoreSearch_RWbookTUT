# StoreSearch_RWbook_iOS Apprentice
StoreSearch, a tutorial app with networking, POST/GET, APIs and more. Last app in the book, so 700+ pages more and i am done!

It is from a book: "iOS Apprentice" from Ray Wenderlich website, written by Matthijs Hollemans and Fahim Farook.

No design here or anything, just practicing :)

*Note - this is a practice project so it is **a bit** rough around the edges. Sorry for that.*
